            <p class=emphasis>
                This started as a running joke...
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always tried to find a way to describe my eccentricity
                to others, usually to no avail. My way of solving problems,
                of thinking and creating, of seeing the world, are so
                fundamentally different from nearly all my friends. So, I often
                found myself trying to describe how my mind worked...and usually
                managed to confuse my friends further.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way I think has a lot of advantages...but it has its
                challenges as well. For one thing, I tend to solve programming
                problems from <em>binary-up</em>, not abstractions-down as
                most programmers do. This is usually an advantage, but it also
                means I'm prone to miss the obvious at times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, while watching <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>
                (my favorite show...I offer no apologies), I happened across
                this joke...
            </p>
            <img class=center src=/common/img/variables.gif />
            <p>
                The familiarity was not lost on me. This was literally my
                first instinct on simple problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pony in question, Doctor Whooves, was named thus by fans
                who recognized his resemblance to the 10th Doctor Who
                (David Tennant); the animators of the series made that joke
                official in this episode.
            </p>
            <p>
                That led me to start watching Doctor Who, something I'd only
                seen in passing prior. Before long, I started to see a striking
                resemblance between the Doctor and my own personality.
                I found that "time lord" was a handy shorthand way of introducing
                my eccentric mind to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I discovered shortly after that revelation that I enjoyed
                wearing bow ties (which really <em>are</em> cool). Yet that fashion
                statement is more than just a reflection of my eccentricity.
                It has given me a basis to tell my story, which continues to
                inspire many people I meet.

        <article>
            <h1>Bigger On The Inside...<span class=cursor>█</span></h1>
            <p>
                I was fairly content with letting "time lord" stand as a
                running joke, but it was about to take on a much deeper meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had <strong>two significant head injuries</strong> in my
                life: one at age two, and one at age sixteen. Both fundamentally
                altered my personality, my abilities, my strengths, and my
                weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before age sixteen, I was decent at math (although
                I hated it with a passion), but I could not understand
                programming to save my life. I much preferred the natural
                sciences, and had intended to go into medicine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, at the end of my sophomore year of high school, I fell
                down a staircase in our house and hit my head on the bannister.
                I suffered a "grade three" traumatic brain injury, going from
                college-level reading and a straight 4.0 GPA to failing pre-K
                level material. It took four years of hard work to regain my
                abilities and graduate high school. I soon discovered that my
                proficiency in the natural sciences was gone. Chemistry and
                biology were now a struggle. Even today, I deal with
                some lingering deficits from the head injury.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, somewhere in the midst of my recovery, I found that I
                loved math...and it loved me back. Algebra and pre-calculus
                just <em>made sense</em>. A desire to make educational
                software led me to try programming again, and this time it stuck.
                I learned three different languages in the course of a year.
                Programming was like breathing! I had discovered that, since the
                head injury, I had gained the ability to visualize in
                six dimensions (yes, seriously), and to work out complex
                problems in my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                In mid-2018, it struck me: <strong>because of the brain
                injuries, I have practically <em>regenerated</em> twice!
                </strong> My core identify has never changed, but how that
                expresses itself in my personality and abilities has.
            </p>
            <p>
                ...and then I saw this, which said everything I felt during
                those first few years after the second head injury:

        <article>
            <h1>The Doctor<span class=cursor>█</span></h1>
            <p>
                My name, Jason, means "healer," something which I
                have always known was also my life's calling. Yet when I
                was younger, I was quite I wanted to be a <strong>doctor</strong>,
                specifically a "pediatric trauma surgeon," as the six-year-old
                me would enthusiastically lisp.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second head injury ended that dream. While I recovered much
                of my academic ability, I never regained the natural proficiency
                for biology that I'd once had. Math and computer science
                gradually took its place in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                My identifying with "The Doctor" was an ironic twist to
                my story. I wasn't a physician, but I was still a doctor of
                sorts: a communicator, a healer of hearts and minds, an
                enigma solver. I rediscovered my lifelong passion for
                teaching, something else I had in common with the character of
                The Doctor. I wanted people's lives to be better for
                encountering me.
            </p>
            <p>
                And yes, that also meant I was, at times, a warrior. You cannot
                really claim to care about justice if you won't stand up against
                injustice. You cannot really be compassionate unless you're also
                willing to stand to protect those who need protecting.
                The Doctor doesn't fight with weapons — neither do I — but
                rather with words, ideas, and at times, good old-fashioned
                psychology.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <p>
                So yes, I'm eccentric. Outright weird, even. I'm passionate,
                definitely (though don't mistake that for "nice"). I may
                sometimes lose you in my flights of intellectual wandering,
                although I swear I'll come back down soon enough. I am most
                certainly a madman with a box...or at least a typewriter.
            </p>
            <p>
                But at the end of the day, I'm just a traveler, helping where
                I can, putting things right again.
