                You've reached the internet home of
                <strong>Jason C. McDonald</strong>, a.k.a. <strong>CodeMouse92</strong>:
                storyteller, communicator, enigma hunter, and bow tie aficionado.
            </p>
            <p>
                Officially, I'm the CEO and Lead Developer at
                <a href=https://mousepawmedia.com target=_blank>MousePaw Media</a>,
                and the Production Editor at

                where my books are also published.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am the Volunteer Community Manager for

            <h2>Who I Am<span class=cursor>█</span></h2>
                <p>
                    I am deeply passionate about <strong>diversity</strong> and
                    <strong>inclusion</strong>! It's the one topic I'll get
                    ferocious about. I have been blessed to be on the receiving
                    end of white American privilege — although I identify more with
                    my oft-invisible Mohawk heritage — and I love using that
                    privilege to amplify diverse voices and to challenge
                    assumptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above all, I am redeemed and continually transformed by
                    the grace and love of God through Jesus Christ, my King.
                    Everything good in me is from Him. I am a member of a church,
                    although denomination matters little to me
                    ("Is Christ divided?" -1 Corinthians 1:13). As to what I
                    believe, the best summary is found in the
                    <a href=https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/creeds/ target=_blank>Apostles, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds</a>.

                    <h2>Code</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have a profound love of programming, with a special
                        appreciation for legacy code, debugging, and low-level
                        languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a deeper level, I love enigmas and other puzzles,
                        of which codes are one type.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class=flex_item>
                    <h2>Mouse</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a prank war nearly two decades ago, I depicted
                        several online friends, and eventually myself, as
                        rodents in an original web game. My character was
                        "Luke D. Mouse", a nerdy little rat who adopted
                        the "Mouse" surname to avoid species discrimination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've had "Mouse" in nearly all my screenames since.
                        It reflects my imagination and my storytelling.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class=flex_item>
                    <h2>92 (Nine-Two)</h2>
                    <p>
                        "And [Jesus] sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of
                        God and to perform healing." -Luke 9:2
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Jason" means "healer", reflective of the calling on
                        my life to bring healing to people's hearts and minds.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions<span class=cursor>█</span></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Q: What do you mean by 'time lord'? Isn't that just a nerd reference?</strong>
                <br/>
                A: 'Time Lord' is a running joke that is actually quite a bit
                bigger on the inside. See that page for more.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q: Wait...you're not Brian Sodano, are you?</strong>
                <br/>
                A: If you're looking for my friend CodeMouse (Brian Sodano),
                you can find him at <a href=https://codemouse.com>codemouse.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q: Isn't your faith incompatible with tolerance?</strong>
                <br/>
                A: Not at all. I'm only called to love everyone as Christ does,
                not "fix" people. Transformation is His department.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Q: Why does your website look like 1998?</strong>
                <br/>
                A: Because I wanted it to.

            <p>
                I'm pretty easy to find online. By and large, the best way to
                get a hold of me is through email or Freenode IRC (##c++-friendly,
                #learn-programming, #python, #ubuntu-offtopic, ##uncomment).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can email me at
                <span class=email>code<span>writing</span>mouse<span>guy</span>92@<span>null</span>outlook.com</span>.
                If you're feeling twitchy about security, you can email
                <span class=email>code<span>writing</span>mouse<span>guy</span>92@<span>null</span>pm.me</span>
                instead.

                stuff they've pulled, I urge everyone to do the same.)
