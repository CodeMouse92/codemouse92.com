            <h1>A Brief History of a Toxic Personality: Marc-Andre Lemburg<span class=cursor>█</span></h1>
            <p>
                The following documents are related to my resignation from the EuroPython Board of Directors, due to the toxic behavior demonstrated by
                the Chair, Marc-Andre Lemburg. In the weeks following my resignation, I was contacted by numerous people expressing support for me,
                and outlining over a decade of toxic behavior on the part of Marc-Andre Lemburg. Few were willing to make official statements, out of
                fear of retaliation, especially as Lemburg enjoys citing his high status in the PSF.
            </p>
            <p>
                I submitted a Code of Conduct complaint against Marc-Andre Lemburg to both the EuroPython Society and the Python Software Foundation.
                The former found my concerns, and those of my co-reporters, to be valid, but did little about the problem, while some members of
                the board covered up the incident, even going as far as to purge my official resignation letter from all community platforms, citing
                CoC related privacy (mine?), although I'd posted the letter. Meanwhile, the latter, the PSF, acknowledged receipt of my complaint, but
                never responded, even six months later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Toxic behavior thrives in silence. I have published the following with the permission of the original reporters, in the interest
                of protecting others from Marc-Andre Lemburg. He cannot be allowed to control the narrative any further.

            <p>
                I encourage the community as a whole to avoid EuroPython as long as Marc-Andre Lemburg is permitted to be involved.
                Additionally, if you have experienced any abusive behavior from Marc-Andre Lemburg, I encourage you to contact me.
                As the PSF has been unwilling to act thus far, our best option as a community is to publicly document and expose Lemburg's toxic behavior.
