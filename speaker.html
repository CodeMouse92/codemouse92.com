            <p>
                I have been speaking since 2013 about programming, communication,
                and professional development, and programming. With over a
                decade of experience in mentoring, teaching, and tutoring, I
                effectively and memorably present advanced concepts to
                listeners of all experience levels. (I am also a
                family-friendly comedian.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Each presentation is tailored to the needs of the particular
                audience, but always delivered with the same humor and passion.

                Check out my podcast with Bojan Miletic, "The Bug Hunters Café",
                where we sit down and chat with developers from all over the world
                about making, fixing, and preventing mistakes in code.

                Python does a shockingly good job at handling multiple
                inheritance. In this emoji-powered talk, learn how Python
                figures out what method to call in a multiple inheritance
                situation, and utilize that to employ mixins in your classes.
                Armed with this knowledge, you'll be prepared to
                swing in as the hero the next time your team is scratching
                their head and asking "why's THAT code getting run??"

            <p>
                Structuring a Python project is often non-trivial. We pick up
                pieces of different patterns and techniques, blindly applying
                them without understanding their implications, in an attempt
                to ship software. Testing and packaging become significant
                pain points for many developers, and this need not be so.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this talk, Jason C. McDonald breaks down the best way to
                structure a Python project for maximum portability and
                maintainability...and more important, explain WHY these
                patterns exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: This talk is slightly out of date. You should be using
                setup.cfg instead of setup.py moving forward. I'll endeavor to
                give a new version of this talk at a later conference.

                You're Doing Objects Wrong (And So Is Everyone Else)

            <p>
                Objects: the thing everyone with an elementary understanding of
                programming feels like they know. It's one of the first things
                a new programmer is taught. And with rare exception, we were
                all taught wrong. In this talk, I explore how objects are
                really supposed to be designed and used, and how that insight
                will transform how you design your classes forever. Whether
                you've been coding in Python for ten minutes or ten years,
                you're almost certain to walk away with a new perspective on
                this most elementary of code structures.

                Writing Zenlike Python

            <p>
                There's a profound gap between working code and Pythonic code.
                To the developer whose first language is NOT Python, the
                distinction can appear blurry, even arbitrary. What is this
                "one obvious way" all those Python nerds are going on about?
                In this talk, I unpack how the twenty principles (including
                the unwritten rule) of Tim Peters' (in)famous Zen of Python
                can guide you to write beautiful, maintainable code, by
                treating Python AS Python!
