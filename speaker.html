            <h1>Speaker and Comedian<span class=cursor>█</span></h1>
            <p>
                I have been speaking since 2013 about communication, professional
                development, and programming. I have presented to computer
                science clubs, university classes, workforce training, and
                iSTEM. I am also a family-friendly comedian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each presentation is tailored to the needs of the particular
                audience, but always delivered with the same humor and passion.
                Through over a decade of experience in teaching and tutoring,
                I’ve learned how to effectively and memorably present
                advanced concepts to listeners of all experience levels.
                I always bring my signature humorous style!
