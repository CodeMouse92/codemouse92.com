                I've been writing stories since I could hold a pencil. My first
                introduction into the professional world of fiction writing came
                when I was invited to join my mother's critique group at age
                eight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I write both non-fiction and fiction. My genres include
                mystery, high fantasy, historical fiction, and humor. I have
                several active projects right now, a few of which are slated
                to be published in 2019.

            <h2>Finding Scrooge</h2>
            <p>
                When Scrooge fails to make his annual appearance at Fred's
                dinner party, everyone is alarmed. Nephew Fred, Bob Cratchit,
                his son Tim, and Martha Cratchit's fiancé Daniel set out to
                locate Mr. Scrooge. Their journey will take them right into one
                of the darkest slums of East London, as they discover what it
                truly means to Keep Christmas Well.
