            <p>
                I've been writing stories since I could hold a pencil. My first
                introduction into the professional world of fiction writing came
                when I was invited to join my mother's critique group at age
                eight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I write both non-fiction and fiction. My genres include
                mystery, high fantasy, historical fiction, and humor. I have two
                books published, and more coming in the near and distant futures.

                    <h2>Dead Simple Python</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dead Simple Python dives deep into the nuts and bolts
                        of the Python programming language. It unpacks the
                        technical "whys" and "hows" of the language's
                        fundamental concepts and helps you use these concepts
                        to write idiomatic Python. Throughout the book,
                        McDonald delves into Python programming concepts like
                        structuring a project, the Python type system,
                        functional and object-oriented programming, loops and
                        iterators, generators and comprehensions, concurrency,
                        distribution, and other essentials.

                    <h2>Noah Clue, P.I.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Noah Clue is at a dead end, having just been fired by his
                        latest client, when his cousin shows up with an offer to help
                        salvage his career. But what happens when an unobservant
                        private investigator and a fastidious legal secretary team up?
                        They turn Seattle upside down!

                    <h2>Finding Scrooge</h2>
                    <p>
                        When Scrooge fails to make his annual appearance at Fred's
                        dinner party, everyone is alarmed. Nephew Fred, Bob Cratchit,
                        his son Tim, and Martha Cratchit's fiancé Daniel set out to
                        locate Mr. Scrooge. Their journey will take them right into one
                        of the darkest slums of East London, as they discover what it
                        truly means to Keep Christmas Well.
